# **Sheet Metal Cone**

![Cone](sheetmetalcone.png)

This extensions draws the 2D shape which is required to form a 3D cone 
(or truncated cone) after it's cut out (of whatever material). 

It can be used to generate a sheet cutting layout for a (truncated) cone.
The extension unfolds a frustum (=truncated cone) or a cone (if cut diameter=0)
and generates a sheet cutting layout or flat pattern projection that can 
be rolled or bend up into a (truncated) cone shape.
